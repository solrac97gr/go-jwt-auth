# Go JWT Auth
Template create for use as CookieCutter for my Golang projects. 
The hardest part for start a project for me was to chose Stack and create the initial login and integrations
like logger, database, etc. So I decided to create a template with everything already working.

## Stack
- Router: Fiber
- Database: Mongo
- Doc :Swagger
- Logger: Zap
- Mocks: gomock
- Deploy: Docker
- CI: Github Actions
